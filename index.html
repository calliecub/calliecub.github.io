		<p>I am an out-of-the-box thinker who likes to create solutions for everyday problems. I think<br />that the process is just as important as the end result in both design and problem-solving.</p> 
		<p>At NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study I created my own major by taking classes<br /> in communications, business, media and philosophy. Through my interdisciplinary studies<br /> I realized that design and content must go hand-in-hand to cultivate a healthy relationship<br /> between a user and a company.</p>
		<p>I am largely self-taught and came to the Startup Institute to solidify my skills in design so that I can create disruptive technology rather than be disrupted by it.</p>
